<h2>The way of PC Building</h2>

<p>Over time new technologies are invented and improved, just like the PCs, they have become a common platform for new generation gamers. Nowadays, most of us, if not all of us want to play games on PC as they become more powerful and supportable to the latest games that are also launched on consoles. So, PC lovers out there have come to the right destination! By following our guide, you will learn how easy the process of building a PC is. You can ensure that each component meets your requirements exactly by learning how to construct your own gaming PC – whether you just want something to run CS:GO at a high refresh rate or a system capable of running the notoriously hard Cyberpunk 2077. </p>

		<h2>Before you build</h2>

		<p>There are a few things to think about before building a computer. First, make sure you understand your own requirements in terms of the components you can afford. You'll know whether building a gaming PC is right for you or if you should go with a prebuilt PC. </p>

		<h2>Choosing a budget and comprehending your requirements</h2>

		<p>How much does a <a href="file:///C:/Users/arjun/OneDrive/Arjun%20Kalia/Shop.html">computer cost?</a> Start by deciding on a budget; component prices vary widely depending on what you want from your PC, so consider whether you want to create an entry-level, mid-range, or high-end gaming PC. </p>

		<h2>Entry-level PC</h2>

		<p>On low settings, a $300-$400 gaming PC can run Street Fighter and Super Smash Bros, but high-definition games will not run. If you want to build a PC only for playing older games, that's OK, but bear in mind that an entry-level gaming PC will severely limit the titles and quality of games you can play.<br><br>If you spend $500-$600 on your gaming PC, you can get a better graphics card or a more powerful processor. This means you'll be able to play some recent AAA games, but they'll have to be run at a lower resolution. So, while it may be a better option for those on a tight budget, it's usually a better idea to wait until you have a bit more cash on hand. You'll then be able to design a gaming PC with significantly improved performance.</p>

		<h2>Mid-level PC</h2>

		<p>A budget of $600-$800 is required to play recent games and even explore the realm of virtual reality gaming. Within this price range, higher graphic settings of 1080p are possible, as well as higher FPS counts of roughly 144+. If you choose an AMD processor, you'll be able to add multi-threading to your PC's list of capabilities. This improves the gameplay of some games and expands the number of games your PC can play.</p>

		<h2>High-level PC</h2>

		<p>With a $800-$1000 budget, you can construct a super-powerful PC that can do far more than simple gaming. You'll be able to buy components that give you a lot of power when playing at 1440p with maxed-out settings. Spending at least $1000 on your PC build will offer you all of the above performance as well as the ability to play games with 4K graphics. Tasks with higher workloads, such as streaming and video rendering, will be handled with ease as well.</p>

		<h2>Build or Prebuilt PC?</h2>

		<p>So, now that you've figured out your budget, you have a better sense of what you can spend. You also have an idea of what your PC should be able to do. Now is a good time to consider whether constructing your own PC is the best option for you or if buying a pre-built gaming PC would be a better fit for your budget. Each has advantages and disadvantages, so let's take a closer look at them below.</p>

		<h2>Build PC</h2>

		<p>Building your own gaming PC gives you a sense of accomplishment that you won't get anywhere else. However, you'll need to be 100% committed to finishing it. You'll also need to know exactly what you'll need, where everything goes, and have a basic understanding of technology. However, by building your own setup, you'll be able to modify it to your exact specifications. Pre-built PCs are similar to a " this is what you will receive" sale. There are no limits when you build your own, and you'll be able to make something that suits your play style and needs.</p>

		<h2>Prebuilt PC</h2>

		<p>To begin, we'll remark that buying a pre-built gaming PC is the ideal alternative for anyone who is technophobic or unsure about building their own computer. Because even the tiniest error can cost you time and money, opt for a pre-built PC if you're not sure what you're doing. Gaming PCs that have been pre-built are also ready to use right away. So, while you won't receive that sense of success, you'll be able to get back to enjoying games much faster.</p>

		<h2>Building Time!</h2>
